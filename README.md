# Whisper Video Transcriber + GPT-4 Summarizer

A Python tool that:

 - Downloads a video from Google Drive or Zoom links,
 - Extracts the audio track,
 - Transcribes the speech using OpenAI Whisper,
 - Generates a friendly class summary using GPT-4 Turbo.


### Requirements

 - Python 3.11+
 - ffmpeg installed and available in your system PATH
 - OpenAI API Key stored in a .env file

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whisper-video-transcriber.git
cd whisper-video-transcriber
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have ffmpeg installed:

### macOS

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Ubuntu/Linux

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```


- Create a .env file with your OpenAI API Key:

```
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" > .env
```

## Usage

Run the script by passing a video link (Google Drive or Zoom):


```
python generate_summary.py "https://drive.google.com/file/d/abc123/view?usp=sharing" --model base
```

You will also be asked to provide a context description (e.g., “Second lecture of the AI MBA course at Infnet. The class was amazing.”)

⚡ You have 30 seconds to enter the context before the script proceeds automatically.

Available Whisper models for transcription:

 - tiny
 - base
 - small
 - medium
 - large



## Outputs

The script saves two files locally:

 - transcript.txt — Full transcription of the video
 - summary.txt — A class-friendly summary generated by GPT-4

Both files will be created in the current working directory.

## ❗ Notes

 1. Only direct download links from Google Drive (shared links) and direct Zoom recordings are supported.
 2.  Make sure your ffmpeg installation is correctly working (ffmpeg -version).
 3. Make sure your OpenAI account has access to GPT-4 Turbo.
